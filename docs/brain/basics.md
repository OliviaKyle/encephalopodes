## Action potentials

All information in the body is sent, received, and encoded in electrical impulses. These are generated by a carefully maintained ionic gradient along the cell membrane, a dual layer of hydrophobic phospholipids between which ions cannot flow except through dedicated gateways. The concentration of Sodium (Na+) and Potassium (K+) ions is kept at exact levels on the outside and inside the cell; during rest, Na will be at a high level outside and low inside, and vice versa for K. This produces a resting potential along the membrane, which acts as a capacitor, of -70 mV. On an externally delivered signal--which could be the arrival of electrical activity from elsewhere in the membrane, or delivery of a neurotransmitter--Sodium channels in the cell membrane will open to allow an influx of sodium ions into the cell by diffusion down their concentration gradient. If this movement of ions increases the potential of the membrane above -55 mV, it initiates a cascading increase in the number of open ion channels and rapidly depolarises the cell to +40 mV. The cell then rapidly repolarises, closing sodium ion channels and opening potassium ion channels within the space of ~1 ms. These de- and re-polarisations constitute an Action Potential, seen in the image below. During repolarisation, the membrane potential can decrease to well below -70 mV in a stage known as hyperpolarisation, during which the cell cannot depolarise again. The cell is then brought back to resting potential by the action of selective membrane transporters, which  exchange internal Na for external K ions, returning them to their resting external and internal concentrations.

## Anatomical perspective terminology

The nervous system is divided into two categories: central and peripheral. The peripheral nervous system is composed of all sensory receptors--the primary sensors of retinal cells in the eyes, olfactory cells in the nose, gustatory cells in the tongue, mechanoreceptors in the skin, and hair cells in the cochlear of the ear--and the nerves that deliver their information to the central nervous system: the brain and brainstem. 

When describing the direction of information flow in a 3-dimensional system, the normal terms of up and down, front and back lack clarity. Anatomical descriptions are then given from the reference of a person in "standard anatomical position"; standing upright facing forwards with both feet and the palms of both hands facing the observer. In this position, left and right are inferred to be from the perspective of the person standing, and are hence reversed from that of the observer. Other position descriptions are given below from a point of reference in the center of the body:

Above -- Superior / Rostral / Cranial

Below -- Inferior / Caudal

Behind -- Posterior / Dorsal

Infront -- Anterior / Ventral

Towards the midline -- Medial

Away from the midline -- Lateral

Near -- Proximal

Far -- Distal

Combining these terms to locate a brain structure in comparison to a known location allows easy navigation of the space, e.g. "dorsolateral" indicates a position behind and towards the outer edge.

As the body tends to be viewed in 2-dimensional slices, further terminology is needed to describe the plane on which the section is taken. The four main planes are the:

## Brain Anatomy

Brain tissue is composed of excitable neurons and surrounding microglia, cells which support neuronal structure and function. The outer "surface" of the brain is called the cortex (grey-matter), which overlies the large body of white-matter. The terms grey- or white- matter refer to the concentration of neuronal cell bodies vs axons; white-matter is predominantly axons, along which action-potentials travel from their incipience at the cell body in the cortex.

 The brain is organised into two fundamentally identical hemispheres; the left and right (from an anatomical perspective). Each hemisphere consists of the large cerebrum and smaller cerebellum, which looks like a tiny brain attached at the back. Each hemisphere of the cerebrum is further refined into functional lobes demarcated by easily recognizable "wrinkles" on it's surface. These wrinkles form the same pattern on every (normal) brain, where the protruding portion of the wrinkle is called a gyrus (plural gyri), and the sunken area is called a sulcus (plural sulci).

In the image below, the FRONTAL LOBE is the anterior portion of the brain, consisting of everything from the frontal pole to the line drawn by the central sulcus. The PARIETAL LOBE is the portion posterior to the frontal lobe, enclosed on three sides by the central sulcus, the lateral fissure, and the sulcus posterior to the angular gyrus. The TEMPORAL LOBE is directly inferior to the parietal, running from the lateral fissure to the inferior temporal gyrus, and extending posteriorly to the preoccipital notch. The OCCIPITAL LOBE is then comprised of the remaining posterior portion of the cerebrum.

Where the edge of a lobe would end at the boundary of the cerebrum from the perspective of this image, imagine them continuing internally along the surface as it curves inwards medially. Viewing a brain sectioned sagitally (along the middle groove between hemispheres) would then look like the image below, where you can imagine each lobe continuing in towards the corpus callosum--the structure joining both hemispheres.

A generalised version of the important landmarks of the lateral cerebrum is shown below.

Acronyms:

CS = Central Sulcus

PoCS = Postcentral Gyrus

PrCS = Precentral Gyrus

SFS = Superior Frontal Sulcus

IFS = Inferior Frontal Sulcus

IPS = Intraparietal Sulcus

LF = Lateral Fissure

ITS = Inferior Temporal Sulcus

STS = Superior Temporal Sulcus

X = Transverse Temporal Gyrus (Heschl's gyrus)

(Delta) = Triangular part of the Inferior Frontal Gyrus

These should cover much of the location terminology used in related research. 

## Functional Areas

Being able to refer to specific areas of the brain is important as all functions occur discreetly, in fixed locations. All afferent sensory information is first delivered from the peripheral nervous system
